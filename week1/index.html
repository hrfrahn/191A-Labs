                <h2 class="right">Mapping Goals</h2>
                <p class = "right">I've loved maps ever since I was a little kid; something about the combination of art, visual storytelling, and the information they can convey makes them unique from other forms of data visualization for me.
                    In this class, I want to learn to use GIS to do more than just make cool maps (which by itself is pretty awesome); 
                    I want to use it to identify social problems and use the power of communnity sourcing to try to tackle those problems.
